# ReaDDy documentation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/readdy/readdy_documentation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/readdy/readdy_documentation)

This repository contains the jekyll source code we use to build our documentation, which is located at the [`readdy/readdy.github.io`](https://github.com/readdy/readdy.github.io) repository.

During the build process, tutorials in the form of ipython notebooks are pulled from [`readdy/readdy_tutorials`](https://github.com/readdy/readdy_tutorials) and rendered into the webpage as well.
