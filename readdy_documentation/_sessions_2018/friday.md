The idea for the friday session is to either
- Continue to create spatial patterns with the diffusion-limited LV model
- Try to simulate a system that you are working on / you know well
- Think of any other scientifically related/unrelated system

At ca. 14h everyone will present their system: a short vmd movie and an explanation of what your system does, how it works.
