Welcome to the website of ReaDDy - a particle-based reaction-diffusion simulator, written in C++ with python bindings.
It is currently in development and not yet fit for use. 
You should [contact us](mailto:readdyadmin@lists.fu-berlin.de) if you want to use it now or in some future project. 
See the [java version](https://github.com/readdy/readdy_java) for a feature-complete but discontinued software.
