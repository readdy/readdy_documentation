title: Summer workshop 2018
---

The workshop adresses young scientists at M.Sc. or Ph.D. student level with a background in physics, chemistry, bioinformatics or computer science. FU-students can receive the equivalent of a 2 SWS module (5 ECTS points) for a successful completion.
The workshop is from Monday 23.07.2018 until Friday 27.07.2018, each day from 9h to 15h.
It will be located in the basement of the computer-science building
```
Takustr. 9
14195 Berlin
Room K46
```
Main topics will be:
- Macromolecular diffusion and crowding
- Simulation of signal transduction in cells
- Particle-based reaction-diffusion simulation
- The Python/C++ based ReaDDy simulation package 

## Program
We will have one talk each morning and hands-on practical sessions afterwards. Friday will be all-day session.

## Prerequisites
There will be Linux PCs available. You are free to bring your own laptop, but note that we currently support Linux and
Mac only. If you bring your own laptop, make sure you have a working 
installation of [VMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). You should be able to run `vmd` from the commandline.

The practical sessions are done in ipython notebooks. A bit of python coding might come in handy, 
but is not required. You will learn the necessary.

## Information for non-resident applicants
PhD students and PostDocs interested in ReaDDy are welcome to participate. To register, send an email to
christoph.froehner(at)fu-berlin.de stating your affiliation and research focus. 

### FindUs 
The workshop takes place at Freie Universität, Department of Mathematics and Informatics. 
The nearest bus stop is "Arnimallee" on the 
Bus X83 route (connecting U Dahlem with S + U Rathaus Steglitz). 
For an area map and directions see [here](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/fb/contact/location.html).

### Accomodation 
Freie Universität does not operate on-campus guest houses or student dormitories. 
Therefore, participants from outside of Berlin must arrange their own accommodation.
