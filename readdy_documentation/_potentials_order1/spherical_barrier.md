A potential that forms a concentric barrier at a certain radius around a given origin. It is given a height
(in terms of energy) and a width. Note that the height can also be negative, then this potential acts as
a 'sticky' sphere. The potential consists of harmonic snippets, such that the energy landscape is continuous
and differentiable, the force is only continuous and not differentiable.
