title: Summer workshop 2019
---

The workshop adresses young scientists at M.Sc. or Ph.D. student level with a background in physics, chemistry, bioinformatics or computer science. 
FU-students can receive the equivalent of a 2 SWS module (5 ECTS points) for a successful completion.
The workshop is from Monday 15.07.2019 until Friday 19.07.2019, each day from 9h to 15h.
It will be located in the math department
```
Arnimallee. 6
14195 Berlin
Room 030
```


Main topics will be:
- Macromolecular diffusion and crowding
- Simulation of signal transduction in cells
- Particle-based reaction-diffusion simulation
- The Python/C++ based ReaDDy simulation package 

## Program
We will have one talk each morning and hands-on practical sessions afterwards. Friday will be all-day session.

## Prerequisites
There will be Linux PCs available. You are free to bring your own laptop, but note that we currently support Linux and
Mac only. If you bring your own laptop, make sure you have a working 
installation of [VMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). You should be able to run `vmd` from the commandline.

The practical sessions are done in ipython notebooks. A bit of python coding might come in handy, 
but is not required. You will learn the necessary.

## Information for non-resident applicants
PhD students and PostDocs interested in ReaDDy are welcome to participate. To register, send an email to
christoph.froehner(at)fu-berlin.de stating your affiliation and research focus. 

### FindUs 
The workshop takes place at Freie Universität, Department of Mathematics and Informatics. 
The nearest bus stop is "Arnimallee" on the 
Bus X83 route (connecting U Dahlem with S + U Rathaus Steglitz). 
For an area map and directions see [here](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/fb/contact/location.html).

### Accomodation 
Freie Universität does not operate on-campus guest houses or student dormitories. 
Therefore, participants from outside of Berlin must arrange their own accommodation. 
The best way to find accommodation and benefit from special deals is booking.com. 
Districts well connected to campus are Steglitz-Zehlendorf, Tempelhof-Schöneberg, Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf as 
well as anything within the so called 'Ringbahn' loop.

### Getting around
Berlin has an extensive public transit network (undergound, urban rail, buses, trams) with 3 tariff zones. 
Ticket AB (2.80€) will get you anywhere in Berlin including Tegel Airport (TXL). 
For Schönefeld Airport (SFX) you will need Ticket ABC (3.40€). See [here](https://www.bvg.de/en/) for reference.
